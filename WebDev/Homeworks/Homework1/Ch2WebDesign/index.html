                <h4>https://sprout.software</h4>

                <p>This website is designed for the software startup "Sprout". This page is appealing and represents a flat yet colourful design. It inherits some skeumorphic elements such as a generative flower and many distinct icons. Additionally, this site performs and scales well for mobile devices.</p>

                <ul>
                    
                    <li>This site follows a minimalist design which compliments the amount of content displayed.</li>
                    
                    <li>The site makes use of good contrast despite the generative colours.</li>

                    <li>There are some effects, however they are subtle and do not distract the user.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Improvements can, and should, be made though. Adding the option for a lighter theme would help with overall accessibility. Finally, enabling more instances of alt text could prove beneficial for those with screen readers or other devices to help with impairements.</p>

                <h4>https://my.fairfield.edu</h4>

                <p>This is a website that was recently overhauled by Fairfield University. Although some elements of the site were improved, many problems still exist, such as inconsistent fonts, usage of a PNG for the header, and vauge images representing services.</p>

                <ul>
                    
                    <li>The site is less cluttered than before, however multiple elements have multiple different fonts.</li>
                    
                    <li>The header is a PNG image which is not ideal for scaling, loading and performance. Additionally, it does not resize well for mobile devices.</li>

                    <li>The images for each service are inconsistent in their colours and their styles. This creates a more cluttered design than intended.</li>

                </ul>

                <p>Rectifying these issues above would help the user experience. Additionally, adding an option to follow the device colour scheme would also be preferable. Finally, improving on the existing CSS media queries or using responsive spacing variables would make the site more responsive to different viewport sizes.</p>
