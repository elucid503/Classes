                Similarly, the Wilson family has many ancestors. The Wilson family has multiple surnames in its ancestory as well. Some of their ancestors are Tim and Bruce. Unlike like the Johnson family, they were born in the 1800s and lived in the United Kingdom. They both had children and grandchildren. Their descendants are still alive today.
